The purpose of this activity is to practice doing heuristic evaluationâ€”in this case, an e-commerce web site. You will need a web browser for this activity.

The web site you will evaluate is **blowoff.com**. Explore at least three parts of the site:

1. Start by evaluating the **home page**;
2. Then evaluate the page for **one product**, such as BlowOff Duster;
3. Finally, try to buy the product and evaluate the **checkout page**.

Record the usability problems you find. Justify every observation by naming one or more **usability heuristics** (design principles) that it violates. Assign a **severity rating** to each problem (cosmetic, minor, major, or catastrophic).

Include at least one **positive** usability comment, again justifying it by naming one or more heuristics.
