The purpose of this activity is to experience what it's like to use a web page with screen reader software.

Go to [WebAnywhere](https://webinsight.cs.washington.edu/wa/), a free, public screen reader implemented as a web proxy. Look over the instructions (particularly the keyboard shortcuts!) and play with it a bit on WebAnywhere's home page.

Then use WebAnywhere to visit [this page](/ans7870/6/6.831/s11/allwhite.html "Link will open in a new window or tab.") (note that you won't see anything, but you'll hear it), and try to answer these questions:

1.  What page is this?
2.  Who is profiled today?
3.  What is today's spotlight?

Assuming you figured out the answer to #1, now go to the real web page and see how easy it is to answer these questions visually by comparison.

Other Resources
---------------

WebAIM (an organization at Utah State University) has created several good simulations of accessibility problems.

Mac OS X has a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver (which you can turn on using System Preferences / Universal Access). For Windows, the screen readers JAWS and Window Eyes both have time-limited trial versions that you can install to see what screen reading is like.

[ADesigner](http://www.eclipse.org/actf/downloads/tools/aDesigner/index.php) helps you check the degree of accessibility of a web page to a screen reader. Among its nice features is a _visual_ display (for the sake of sighted designers) of the time cost of reaching each HTML node in the page using a typical screen reader.
