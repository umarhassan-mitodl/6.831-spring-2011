{{< resource 8f71c12b-ec6b-4381-d1e1-a5a840cd1386 >}} The purpose of this activity is to practice designing UIs by sketching. Your goal is to design an interface for controlling the LCD projectors in a classroom like this one. Here's some relevant information from analysis.

### Hardware

The room you're designing for has:

*   Two video signal channels sent to a system of LCD projectors arranged in pairs, capable of projecting two different images side-by-side against each wall of the room, so that all students can see the projected images;
*   One cable for a laptop;
*   One desktop PC permanently installed in the room;
*   Ten numbered whiteboards around the walls, each with its own camera focused on it.

### Users

**Lecturers** are generally faculty members, aged 30-70. All have laptops. Some prepare lectures using PowerPoint; others prefer handwritten notes that they transcribe to blackboards or whiteboards. They don't have time to take a training class about A/V equipment.

### Tasks

*   **Give lecture,** which includes as subtasks:
    *   **Show slides.**
    *   **Write on board,** which may include as a subtask:
        *   **Hide slides** to avoid distraction.
    *   **Show other material** such as videos, web sites, or demos.
*   **Do small-group activity.** Activities happen at the whiteboards around the room. This task includes as subtasks:
    *   **Explain the activity,** which may involve showing a slide, writing on the board, or showing a web page.
    *   **Discuss a group's results** by showing its whiteboard so that the whole class can see it easily.

Design Sketches
---------------

Design the interface that controls the two video signals going to the LCD projectors. (Assume that your interface will run on the built-in PC, so you have a keyboard, mouse, and high-resolution display.) **Sketch at least three different designs.** To help broaden your thinking, consider alternatives like this:

*   a direct manipulation design
*   a menu-and-forms design, using standard widgets
*   a wizard

...but you aren't limited to these.

Discussion
----------

After drawing your sketches, discuss their pros and cons. Think about:

*   How simple are your designs? Can you reduce them further, or force elements to do double-duty?
*   How well do your designs support the tasks?
*   Which aspects of usability matter for these users and these tasks? How do your designs fare on those aspects?
*   What if MIT decided to staff the classroom with a full-time A/V operator?
*   How flexible are your designs for unexpected or new tasks?
